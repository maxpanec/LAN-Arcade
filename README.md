# LAN-Arcade
Designed a multiplayer pong application that lets users either host or join a game.
This is my first ever coding project. I completed it in October 2020 when I was just learning to code.
Hosting a game creates a local area network server others can join.
Users can add ip and ports to a server list to join games with.
